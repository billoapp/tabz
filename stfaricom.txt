Overview

LIPA NA M-PESA ONLINE API also known as M-PESA express is a Merchant/Business initiated C2B (Customer to Business) transaction. Once the merchant integrates to the API, they can then initiate a payment authorization prompt to a customer whose phone number is registered and active on M-PESA.

How It Works

The Merchant (Partner) captures and sets the required API parameters and sends the API request.

The API receives the request, validates it internally, and sends an acknowledgment response.

Through the API Proxy, a network-initiated push request is sent to the M-PESA-registered phone number of the customer making the payment.

The customer confirms the payment by entering their M-PESA PIN.

The response is sent back to M-PESA and processed as follows:

M-PESA validates the customer's PIN.

M-PESA debits the customer's mobile wallet.

M-PESA credits the Merchant (Partner) account.

Once the request is processed, the results are sent back to the API Management system, which then forwards them to the merchant via the callback URL specified in the request.

The customer receives an SMS confirmation message for the payment.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Create a Daraja Account on Safaricom Developer Portal.

Create a sandbox app in the portal to get API credentials.

Retrieve Consumer Key & Consumer Secret from your sandbox app on My Apps.

Test data available on the simulator section

Passkey for encryption of the password parameter-on sandbox this is availed on test data on the simulator, in production this will be send on developer email after go-live

Live M-PESA pay bill/till number with Business Admin/Manager operators created - For Go live

Good to Know

This API is asynchronous. You can consume this API over the internet, a virtual private network or Multiprotocol Switch.

Get Auth Token

Devs gather here! You will first generate an access token to authenticate you to make the API call. See below generate access token API here. We’ve also automated this on the simulate request section.

Use Cases

Reduction of wrong payments/reversals Wrong payments are significantly reduced because customers only need to enter their M-PESA PIN to validate transactions. There's no need to remember or manually input the pay bill/till number, amount, or account number—these details are pre-set by the merchant and included in the M-PESA push request.

Enhanced and shorter payment journey

How To

Access to the M-PESA Organization Portal and create Users

The M-PESA organization portal is a platform designed for businesses and organizations to manage their financial transactions through the M-PESA services.

The portal offers various features for businesses, including:

Transaction Management: Monitor and manage transactions, generate reports, and reconcile accounts.

Account Management: Manage multiple user accounts with different access levels within the organization.

Bulk Payments: Facilitate bulk payments to employees, suppliers, and other beneficiaries efficiently.

Access to the M-PESA Organization Portal



To access the Organization portal (https://org.ke.m-pesa.com/orglogin.action), you need to have a Business Administrator role created under your business short code (Pay Bill/ Till).

The first step before getting access, is to ensure the settlement option set to your short code is Bank via a Head Office application.

To make an application for a Head Office for your short code/Store Number kindly contact M-PESABusiness@Safaricom.co.ke where they will provide you with the forms to be filled.

After Head Office is created the M-PESABusiness@Safaricom.co.ke will also guide on the creation of the Business Administrator (username).

How to login to M-PESA Organization Portal For the first time:

Launch the link from any of the browsers: https://org.ke.m-pesa.com.

Enter the Short code which is Bulk payment number.

Enter the Business Administrator username received

Account Types in C2B Organization

MMF/WORKING/M-PESA ACCOUNT FOR ORGANIZATION

When an organization wants to make a business withdrawal, the funds are transferred to this account before the withdrawal request is made.

UTILITY ACCOUNT

Payments from customers are credited into the utility account.

CHARGES PAID ACCOUNT

For payments received from customers, depending on the tariff, a charge is levied on the Organization or is split between the organization and the customer. The charges paid account is debited and always accrues a negative balance which has to be settled before an organization can make a withdrawal request.

ORGANIZATION SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT

This account does the calculations for the organization operator when s/he initiates a revenue settlement. This account settles the charges paid account and then moves the balance from the Utility Account to the MMF account automatically. You will notice that the transaction type “Move funds from Utility to MMF” is no longer available as the revenue settlement process takes care of this.
